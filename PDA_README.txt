In this short manual I will explain how to install and start up the relevant software, and how to read and navigate the notebooks. 

First, the following application is required to run the notebooks: 
* Jupiter notebook, with python 3 kernel

How to install Jupyter notebook? There are two options: 
1) Use the terminal. Type in terminal: 'pip install notebook' followed by 'Jupyter notebook'
For more information: https://jupyter.org/install
2) Install Anaconda 3 navigator. This option is preferable. If you haven't already
-Go to website: https://www.anaconda.com/download
-Provide E-mail adres. 
-Download the Anaconda Installers for your operation system. Can be Windows, Mac, or Linux

After installation you can start the Jupyter notebook directly by clicking on its icon in your applications or start menu. You can also open the anaconda navigator and find the Jupyter notebook application there. If the Jupyter notebook is not installed within the Anaconda environment yet, you can easily click the install button, and that would also install the Jupyter notebook. 

Important! Within the Jupyter notebook files there are suggestions and short explanations within coding cells starting with a '#' These may include: 
				- Taking an action
				- Code clarification
				- To display additional coding sources
				- To hide some coding lines
Following these should ensure that the results are reproduceable, with running the code lines in the Jupyter Notebook. The most important thing is to load the dataset from your own personal file path to the notebook itself. This can be done by having the datasets on your desktop and indicating the file path in the code line, or having them in the same file as the notebooks. 

And plaese start with Notebook 1: Data Exploration. Then Part2, and then Part3. 

Good luck in navigation the notebook files!
